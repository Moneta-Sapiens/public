    <h1>1. What is Moneta Sapiens?</h1>
    <h3>Moneta Sapiens is a fintech company founded on the scientific discovery of Coin Entropy: a method for measuring the underlying value of any currency—including Bitcoin and traditional money—without relying on market prices.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Think of it like discovering a thermometer for money. Just as we can measure the temperature of water without asking people how hot they think it feels, Moneta Sapiens has developed a way to measure the actual value of currencies using mathematical principles from physics and information theory. Our breakthrough reveals the currency's fundamental worth independent of daily market fluctuations, sentiment, or manipulation. Coin Entropy represents <strong>the first scientific method to determine absolute value in finance</strong>.</p>

    <h1>2. What is Coin Entropy?</h1>
    <h3>Coin Entropy is a scientific measurement of the "amount of information" in each coin — similar to how scientists measure energy in physical systems — that correlates 80-95% with market prices without using any price data.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Imagine if you could look at every wallet and bank account for a currency and see exactly how the money is spread out and where it moved. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain makes this information publically available. Coin Entropy measures these patterns using the same mathematical principles that physicists use to understand energy and information. For example, when money is more evenly distributed, the entropy is higher and the currency is more valuable and stable, and when it's concentrated in few hands, entropy is lower and the currency is more volatile and vulnerable. This gives us an objective, absolute, and universal way to determine what a currency should actually be worth, regardless of what people are willing to pay for it on any given day.</p>

    <h1>3. What problem does this solve?</h1>
    <h3>Coin Entropy solves the fundamental problem that no one really knows what money is actually worth—we only know what people are willing to pay for it right now, which changes constantly due to emotions, manipulation, and market conditions.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Currently, coin prices fluctuate wildly based on news, emotions, rumors, and manipulation by large players. Investors and institutions have no reliable way to know if they're buying at a fair price or if a currency is truly undervalued or overvalued. This creates massive inefficiencies, bubbles, and crashes. Coin Entropy provides the missing piece: an objective, scientific baseline that shows what currencies should be worth based on their fundamental mathematical properties, allowing for truly informed investment decisions.</p>

<div>
    <h1>4. Why is Coin Entropy better than current valuation methods?</h1>
    <h3>Unlike current methods which rely on subjective market sentiment, Coin Entropy provides an objective, mathematical measurement that cannot be manipulated because it's based on verifiable data.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Current valuation methods of currencies can be compared to the effort to determine temprature without a thermometer: the answers are subjective and can vary considerably. Coin Entropy, in contrast, is such a "thermometer" but for money. It provides an objective, universal, and accurate reflection of the currency's underlying reality. Unlike prices, Coin Entropy is immune to market sentiment, trading manipulation, media hype, and the whims of large investors, because it's based purely on mathematical analysis of distribution patterns, re-using tried-and-tested methods of information theory — methods which have successfully been applied to a wide range of disciplines, from ecology to finances. Our research shows 80-95% correlation of Coin Entropy with actual market prices over time, meaning we can predict fair value with remarkable accuracy. Most importantly, it clearly indicates when markets are significantly overvalued or undervalued, giving investors a crucial edge.</p>

    <h1>5. Who can benefit from Coin Entropy measurements?</h1>
    <h3>Individual investors, traders, banks, hedge funds, and central banks can all benefit from finally having an objective way to make data-driven financial decisions.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>The discovery of Coin Entropy has applications across the entire financial ecosystem. Individual investors can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell by knowing if currencies are over- or undervalued. Professional traders and hedge funds can develop more sophisticated strategies based on scientific value rather than guesswork. Banks and financial institutions can better assess risk and price their services appropriately. Even central banks and governments could use these measurements to make more informed monetary policy decisions, such as understanding the real impact of printing money or setting interest rates. Because our method works for any currency—cryptocurrencies, dollars, euros, or any other money—it could revolutionize how the entire global financial system understands and values money.</p>
