    <h1>1. Who Are We?</h1>
    <h3>Moneta Sapiens is the first analytics company to offer an objective and universal measurement of cryptocurrency value — providing mathematical precision where the industry has relied on approximation and guesswork.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Just as the thermometer revolutionized medicine by replacing subjective temperature assessment with objective measurement, Moneta Sapiens has created the first scientific framework for measuring cryptocurrency value through Coin Entropy. Our systematic methodology transforms digital asset analysis from art to science, enabling investors and regulators to make data-driven decisions based on mathematical precision rather than market sentiment. This fundamental breakthrough establishes the missing foundation for institutional-grade cryptocurrency evaluation and regulatory oversight.</p>

    <h1>2. What is Coin Entropy?</h1>
    <h3>Borrowed from information theory, Coin Entropy is an objective, absolute, and universal measurement system for cryptocurrency valuation, which quantifies digital asset risk and stability with mathematical precision — correlating highly with market prices without using any price data.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Coin Entropy establishes systematic methodology for measuring the distribution patterns and network dynamics of any cryptocurrency, providing quantifiable insights that were previously impossible to obtain. When digital assets show higher entropy, they demonstrate greater stability and resistance to manipulation, while lower entropy signals increased volatility and concentration risk. This breakthrough enables investors to identify undervalued assets and assess genuine market conditions independent of sentiment-driven price fluctuations. For regulators, Coin Entropy provides standardized metrics for risk assessment and market oversight, creating the evidence-based foundation needed for informed policy decisions.</p>

    <h1>3. What problem does this solve?</h1>
    <h3>Coin Entropy eliminates the fundamental uncertainty in cryptocurrency valuation by replacing subjective assessment and market sentiment with mathematical precision and evidence-based measurement.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Currently, cryptocurrency markets operate without consensus on fundamental value, creating extreme volatility driven by speculation, manipulation, and sentiment rather than underlying asset quality. Institutional investors face regulatory compliance challenges when allocating capital to digital assets without objective risk assessment frameworks. Regulators struggle to develop appropriate oversight policies due to the lack of standardized measurement tools. Coin Entropy addresses these critical gaps by providing the first systematic methodology for cryptocurrency evaluation — enabling institutional investors to make fiduciary-compliant investment decisions while giving regulators the evidence-based metrics necessary for informed policy development and market stability oversight.</p>

<div>
    <h1>4. Why is Coin Entropy better than current valuation methods?</h1>
    <h3>Unlike current approaches — which rely on subjective interpretation, incomplete data, and raw performance metrics — Coin Entropy provides the first mathematically rigorous framework resilient to manipulation because it measures fundamental coin distribution and network properties directly.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Traditional cryptocurrency valuation methods suffer from extreme sensitivity to assumption changes and lack standardized frameworks for institutional analysis. Current on-chain metrics can be gamed or manipulated, while sentiment-based market prices are inadequate for precise valuation. Coin Entropy represents a paradigm shift to systematic methodology. Our approach delivers consistent, reproducible results that correlate strongly with market performance while remaining immune to manipulation attempts. This establishes the evidence-based foundation that institutional investors require for confident capital allocation and enables regulators to develop informed oversight frameworks based on quantifiable risk assessment.</p>

    <h1>5. Who can benefit from Coin Entropy measurements?</h1>
    <h3>Institutional investors, cryptocurrency funds, regulatory agencies, and financial institutions gain the systematic risk assessment and evidence-based decision-making capabilities required for professional cryptocurrency market participation.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>more...</summary>
        <p>Coin Entropy transforms provides institutional-grade measurement across the entire financial ecosystem. 
            <ul>
            <li>Hedge funds and investment managers can generate systematic alpha through objective asset selection and risk-adjusted portfolio construction, while meeting fiduciary responsibilities for investor protection. </li>
            <li>Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms gain enhanced market surveillance capabilities and regulatory compliance tools for detecting manipulation and managing systemic risk.</li>
            <li>Regulatory agencies receive standardized metrics for market oversight, enabling evidence-based policy development and enforcement actions. </li>
            <li>Even traditional financial institutions exploring digital asset integration benefit from the systematic framework needed for due diligence and regulatory approval processes. Since our methodology works universally across digital assets, it establishes the mathematical foundation for mature cryptocurrency markets that institutional participation requires.</li>
